## _Academic Bio_
In Fall of 2023, I transferred from [De Anza College](https://www.deanza.edu/) in Cupertino to [UC San Diego](https://www.deanza.edu/), to persue a degree in Computer Science. I decided to study this field only after I reluctantly took a programming class, with the insistance of my family. I quickly realized that I was talented at coding, and that I enjoyed it, too. After further coursework at De Anza College, including classes like [Data Structures](https://www.deanza.edu/faculty/garbaceadelia/cis22c.html), [Object Oriented Analysis and Design](https://www.deanza.edu/schedule/class-details.html?crn=23076&y=2022&q=F), and [x86 Assembly](https://www.deanza.edu/faculty/nguyenclare/cis21ja.html), I was able and grateful to transfer to UCSD, where I took more advanced coursework. My favorite classes so far include [Advanced Data Structures](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse100), [Theory of Computability](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse105), and [Computer Organization and Systems Programming](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse30).  

Some classes that I look forward to are:
-  [Programming Languages: Principles and Paradigms](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse130)
-  [Components and Design Techniques for Digital Systems](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse140)
-  [Introduction to Modern Cryptography](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse107)

My future goals include obtaining a Graduate Level Degree in Computer Science, desireably here at UCSD. I find that I particularly enjoy theory courses, so I expect that I would specialize in that area, with nothing specific in mind yet. I expect to make a well informed decision after I have taken a wide variety of courses.
